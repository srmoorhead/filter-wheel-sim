# filter-wheel-sim
A simulator for a filter wheel modeled on a doubly-linked list with filter transition times of 0.5 seconds.  Used in testing the filter-wheel-control interface.  Added to a separate repository for availability to the community as a resource for any future filter wheel application development in C#.
